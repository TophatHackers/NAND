Registers:
#0: PC - Program Counter
#1: RN - NAND Output
#2 - #7: r0 - r5: General use registers

8 bit instructionset:

2 bit - OPcode:
00 - NAND - RN = A NAND B
01 - sys - See sys
10 - START - Identifies start of instruction chain - sets rt and rs to r0 and r1.
11 - END - Identifies end of instruction chain - sets rs to final output

S-Type (identified by OP = 01):
2 bit OP (identifier)
2 bit ID (Special identifier):
00 - STACK
01 - READ
10 - WRITE
11 - TBD


STACK: 
1 bit PUSH or POP (0 = PUSH, 1 = POP)
3 bit rs (input 1)

READ:
3 bit rs

WRITE:
3 bit rs


I-type:
2 bit OP (identifier)
3 bit rs (input 1)
3 bit rt (input 2)
