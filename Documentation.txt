Registers:
#0: PC - Program Counter
#1: RN - NAND Output
#2 - #7: r0 - r5: General use registers

8 bit instructionset:

2 bit - OPcode:
00 - NAND - RN = A NAND B
01 - sys - See sys
10 - Loop (START/END) - START/END identified by last 3 bits, if all are 0 then END otherwise START
11 - BIT - read/writes specific bit in r4 given by 5bit imm and reads/writes to r5.

Sys (identified by OP = 01):
2 bit OP (identifier)
2 bit ID (Special identifier):
00 - STACK
01 - READ
10 - WRITE
11 - TBD


STACK: 
1 bit PUSH or POP (0 = PUSH, 1 = POP)
3 bit rs (input 1)

READ:
3 bit rs

WRITE:
3 bit rs


NAND:
2 bit OP (identifier)
3 bit rs (input 1)
3 bit rt (input 2)

START: - Puts rs and rt into r0 and r1 of subprocess
2 bit OP (identifier)
3 bit rs (input 1)
3 bit rt (input 2)

END: - Puts rn into rs of parent process.
2 bit OP (identifier)
3 bit rs (input 1)
3 bit 0-padding

BIT: 
2 bit OP (identifier)
1 bit ID (0 = read, 1 = write)
5 bit Index (IMM 0-31)

bit READ:
r5 = r4[imm]

bit WRITE:
r4[imm] = r5
